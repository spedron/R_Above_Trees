A project for the scientific results of the 2017-2018 research regarding greening/browning NDVI trends,
funded by NASA ABoVE #NNX15AU16A (to Michael Goulden and Claudia Czimczik) 

## Getting Started

Work out of the ABoVE_trees_Master script. From here, you can source all datasets and functions, and save outputs. 
* The `Setup` foldable section will check your system for required packages and install if necessary. 
* It will then read them in from the library, as well as functions and themes.
* Raw data will be read and formatted from `Datasets\Raw `. 
* Processed data will be saved into `Datasets\Processsed`

### Plots

Create and save plots relevant to the project. 
* Fig. 3: Chronosequences of composition (based on percent cover) of upper and lower canopies, and ground cover binned by stand age in 50 year intervals for each successional stage.
* Fig. 5: Chronosequences of NDVI of all sites visited, separated by dominant vegetation in the upper canopy during 2017–2018. 
* Fig. 7:  Relationships between fraction deciduous and NDVI, and LAI and NDVI of boreal forest stands in Interior Alaska, USA.

## Data

Data for these analyses are available in the `Datasets` directory. 
All data for the publication are openly available at: https://arcticdata.io/catalog/view/urn:uuid:b8b922e4-7da2-486f-88e5-daed3a4501e3
