# R_EAGER

A project for the scientific results of the 2017-2018 research regarding greening/browning NDVI trends,
funded by NASA ABoVE #NNX15AU16A (to Michael Goulden and Claudia Czimczik) 

## Getting Started

Work out of the ABoVE_trees_Master script. From here, you can source all datasets and functions, and save outputs. 
* The "Setup" foldable section will check your system for required packages and install if necessary. 
* It will then read them in from the library, as well as functions and themes.
* Raw data will be read and formatted. 
* Processed data will be saved into Datasets\Processsed

### Plots

Plots foldable section creates and saves plots relevant to the project. 
* Figure 4 plots NDVI against stand age
* Figure 5 plots NDVI against LAI, filled by fraction deciduous
* Surveys show results of forest surveys
